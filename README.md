# littleARgame
Draft for an AR game featuring a vehicle fetching objects, extremely basic yet functional.
Starting with a Unity project in Google Codelab ( https://codelabs.developers.google.com/arcore-unity-ar-foundation#0 ), I built both the iOS and the Android version.
3D escavator model from Kenney's Car Kit : https://www.kenney.nl/assets/car-kit
I am going to upload at least the Android apk - as soon as I find my way with GitHub Desktop.
