# littleARgame
Draft for an AR game featuring a vehicle fetching objects, extremely basic yet functional.
Starting with a Unity project in Google Codelab ( https://codelabs.developers.google.com/arcore-unity-ar-foundation#0 ), I built both the iOS and the Android version: here you find a video recording taken in an iPhone X and the .apk file that you can download and play in your Android device.
